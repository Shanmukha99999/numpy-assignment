# numpy-assignment
The assignment was provided by Learn and Build organisation.
The assignment consits of basic questions on numpy.
The questions are as follows.


1. Given are 2 similar dimensional numpy arrays, how to get a numpy array output
in which every element is an element-wise sum of the 2 numpy arrays?
2. Given a numpy array (matrix), how to get a numpy array output which is equal to
the original matrix multiplied by a scalar?
3. Create an identity matrix of dimension 4-by-4.
4. Convert a 1-D array to a 3-D array
5. Convert a binary numpy array (containing only 0s and 1s) to a boolean numpy
array
6. Convert all the elements of a numpy array from float to integer datatype
7. Stack 2 numpy arrays horizontally i.e., 2 arrays having the same 1st dimension
(number of rows in 2D arrays)
8. Output a sequence of equally gapped 5 numbers in the range 0 to 100 (both
inclusive)
9. Output a matrix (numpy array) of dimension 2-by-3 with each and every value
equal to 5
10.Given 2 numpy arrays as matrices, output the result of multiplying the 2 matrices
(as a numpy array)
11. Output the array element indexes such that the array elements appear in the
ascending order
12.Multiply a 5x3 matrix by a 3x2 matrix (real matrix product).
